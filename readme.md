## Things to do

I still need to create the example of a package that is cross-platform and
depends on another cross-platform package (@cross/core).

## Updates

The type inference is working great, but when I'm running or building the application
with the `.native` config, it's not mapping correctly using Vite.

I will try to compile the packages with `tsc` to see if the final result changes.

Maybe the only way to compile `.native` is using the React Native CLI, I'm trying that.
